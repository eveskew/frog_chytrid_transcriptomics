Observed 4554186 total fragments (4554186 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 12:04:20.681] [jointLog] [info] Computed 192849 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 12:04:20.681] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3292261 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 12:04:23.982] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3292261 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
