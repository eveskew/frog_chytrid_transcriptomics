Observed 5332906 total fragments (5332906 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:53:46.107] [jointLog] [info] Computed 202447 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:53:46.107] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3788997 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:53:49.383] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3788997 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
