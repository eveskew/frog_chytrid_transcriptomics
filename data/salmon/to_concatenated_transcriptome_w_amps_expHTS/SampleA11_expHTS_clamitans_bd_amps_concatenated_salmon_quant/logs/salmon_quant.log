Observed 2651174 total fragments (2651174 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:09:27.597] [jointLog] [info] Computed 141308 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:09:27.597] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1919430 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:09:30.930] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1919430 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
