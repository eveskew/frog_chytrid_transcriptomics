Observed 1456257 total fragments (1456257 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 09:34:28.229] [jointLog] [info] Computed 68427 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 09:34:28.229] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1083372 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 09:34:31.537] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1083372 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
