Observed 5756687 total fragments (5756687 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:20:28.555] [jointLog] [info] Computed 244889 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:20:28.555] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4462883 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:20:31.785] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4462883 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
