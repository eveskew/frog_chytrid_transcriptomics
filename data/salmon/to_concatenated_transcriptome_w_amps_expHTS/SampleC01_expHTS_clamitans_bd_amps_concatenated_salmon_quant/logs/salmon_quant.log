Observed 1488839 total fragments (1488839 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:59:37.271] [jointLog] [info] Computed 66636 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:59:37.271] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1147272 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:59:40.717] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1147272 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
