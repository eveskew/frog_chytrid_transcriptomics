Observed 1306322 total fragments (1306322 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 11:49:31.969] [jointLog] [info] Computed 61992 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 11:49:31.969] [jointLog] [info] Counted 975677 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 11:49:35.389] [jointLog] [warning] Only 975677 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
