Observed 6391665 total fragments (6391665 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 12:12:42.248] [jointLog] [info] Computed 237577 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 12:12:42.248] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4616615 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 12:12:45.398] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4616615 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
