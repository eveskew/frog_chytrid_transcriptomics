Observed 5769067 total fragments (5769067 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 12:37:53.621] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4551305 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 12:37:56.874] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4551305 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
