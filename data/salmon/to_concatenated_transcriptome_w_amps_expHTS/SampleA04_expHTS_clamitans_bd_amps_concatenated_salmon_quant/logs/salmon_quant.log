Observed 418639 total fragments (418639 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 09:38:41.719] [jointLog] [info] Computed 31189 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 09:38:41.719] [jointLog] [info] Counted 300075 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 09:38:45.098] [jointLog] [warning] Only 300075 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
