Observed 2229847 total fragments (2229847 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 12:57:25.124] [jointLog] [info] Computed 131031 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 12:57:25.124] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1775111 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 12:57:28.631] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1775111 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
