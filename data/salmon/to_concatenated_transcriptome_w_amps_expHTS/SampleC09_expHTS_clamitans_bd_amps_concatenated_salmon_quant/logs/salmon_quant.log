Observed 6687614 total fragments (6687614 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 11:32:41.072] [jointLog] [info] Computed 253181 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 11:32:41.072] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4878653 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 11:32:44.379] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4878653 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
