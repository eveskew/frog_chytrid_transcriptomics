Observed 5738851 total fragments (5738851 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 14:19:34.318] [jointLog] [info] Computed 237401 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 14:19:34.318] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4456509 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 14:19:37.425] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4456509 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
