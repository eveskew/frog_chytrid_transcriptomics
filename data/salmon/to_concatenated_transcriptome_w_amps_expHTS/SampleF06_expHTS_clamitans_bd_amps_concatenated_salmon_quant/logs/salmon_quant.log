Observed 5308390 total fragments (5308390 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:28:16.200] [jointLog] [info] Computed 225602 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:28:16.200] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4135211 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:28:19.534] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4135211 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
