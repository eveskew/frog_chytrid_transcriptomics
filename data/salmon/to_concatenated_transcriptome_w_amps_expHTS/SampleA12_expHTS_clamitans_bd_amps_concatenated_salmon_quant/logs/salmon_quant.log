Observed 6773184 total fragments (6773184 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:14:12.295] [jointLog] [info] Computed 245587 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:14:12.295] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4907099 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:14:15.504] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4907099 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
