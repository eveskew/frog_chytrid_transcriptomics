Observed 6422390 total fragments (6422390 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:39:54.454] [jointLog] [info] Computed 249546 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:39:54.454] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4902752 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:39:57.152] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4902752 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
