Observed 3877125 total fragments (3877125 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:48:24.007] [jointLog] [info] Computed 170978 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:48:24.007] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3045901 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:48:26.715] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3045901 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
