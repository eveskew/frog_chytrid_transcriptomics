Observed 637490 total fragments (637490 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 12:13:35.678] [jointLog] [info] Computed 41738 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 12:13:35.678] [jointLog] [info] Counted 456752 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 12:13:38.616] [jointLog] [warning] Only 456752 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
