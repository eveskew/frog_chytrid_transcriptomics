Observed 1748950 total fragments (1748950 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 12:27:17.745] [jointLog] [info] Computed 77625 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 12:27:17.745] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1312067 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 12:27:20.999] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1312067 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
