Observed 2736849 total fragments (2736849 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 09:36:21.019] [jointLog] [info] Computed 128031 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 09:36:21.019] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2050252 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 09:36:24.341] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2050252 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
