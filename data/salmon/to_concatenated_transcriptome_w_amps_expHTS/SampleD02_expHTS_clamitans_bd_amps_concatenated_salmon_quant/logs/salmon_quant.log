Observed 3224364 total fragments (3224364 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 11:45:40.729] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2438102 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 11:45:44.024] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2438102 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
