Observed 2916365 total fragments (2916365 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:10:09.680] [jointLog] [info] Computed 133349 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:10:09.680] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2201346 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:10:13.044] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2201346 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
