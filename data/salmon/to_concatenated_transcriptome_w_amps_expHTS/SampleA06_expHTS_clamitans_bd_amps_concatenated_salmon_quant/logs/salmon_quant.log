Observed 2618873 total fragments (2618873 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 09:47:02.420] [jointLog] [info] Computed 106862 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 09:47:02.420] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2024115 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 09:47:05.792] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2024115 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
