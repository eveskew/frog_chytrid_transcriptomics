Observed 3123132 total fragments (3123132 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:16:27.632] [jointLog] [info] Computed 131773 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:16:27.632] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2545476 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:16:31.035] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2545476 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
