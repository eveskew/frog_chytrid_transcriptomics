Observed 1967432 total fragments (1967432 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 11:38:26.484] [jointLog] [info] Computed 89071 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 11:38:26.484] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1450288 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 11:38:29.781] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1450288 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
