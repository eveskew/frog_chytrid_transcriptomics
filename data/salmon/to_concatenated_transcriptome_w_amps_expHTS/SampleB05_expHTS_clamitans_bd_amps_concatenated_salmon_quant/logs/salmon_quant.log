Observed 1223886 total fragments (1223886 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:26:03.775] [jointLog] [info] Computed 64309 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:26:03.775] [jointLog] [info] Counted 914513 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:26:06.520] [jointLog] [warning] Only 914513 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
