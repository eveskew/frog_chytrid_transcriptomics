Observed 4889483 total fragments (4889483 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:57:24.695] [jointLog] [info] Computed 203008 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:57:24.695] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3756838 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:57:27.881] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3756838 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
