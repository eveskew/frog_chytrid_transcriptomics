Observed 1618841 total fragments (1618841 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 10:20:36.860] [jointLog] [info] Computed 72943 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 10:20:36.860] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1186188 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 10:20:40.252] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1186188 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
