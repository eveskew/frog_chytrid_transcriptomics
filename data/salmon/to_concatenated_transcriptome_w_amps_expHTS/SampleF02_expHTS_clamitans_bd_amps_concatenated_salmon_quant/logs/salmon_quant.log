Observed 5159434 total fragments (5159434 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:14:10.758] [jointLog] [info] Computed 206484 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:14:10.758] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3744684 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:14:14.022] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3744684 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
