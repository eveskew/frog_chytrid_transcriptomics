Observed 5012812 total fragments (5012812 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:35:37.001] [jointLog] [info] Computed 205135 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:35:37.001] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3857111 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:35:40.325] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3857111 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
