Observed 5751541 total fragments (5751541 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 11:27:47.232] [jointLog] [info] Computed 218477 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 11:27:47.232] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4253744 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 11:27:50.393] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4253744 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
