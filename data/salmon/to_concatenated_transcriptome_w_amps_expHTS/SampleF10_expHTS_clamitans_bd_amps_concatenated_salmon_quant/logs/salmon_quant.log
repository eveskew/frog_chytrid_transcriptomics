Observed 1456247 total fragments (1456247 in most recent round)

[2016-08-14 13:41:02.978] [jointLog] [info] Computed 75228 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2016-08-14 13:41:02.978] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1087977 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2016-08-14 13:41:06.253] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1087977 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
